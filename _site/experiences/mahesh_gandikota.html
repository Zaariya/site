S.K. Shukriya had just left work in the canteen of a hospital. Due to the physical violence he had to face, he stopped going to work and school. Shukriya is very talkative, loves to cycle, involves in brawls and speaks only the truth.

The first day I met him, he enthusiastically narrated several things about his life – the number of friends he has at home, his visit to the Nandankaanan zoo, how the nurses at the hospital (his last workplace) love him, how he avenges anyone who bullies him and so on.

To make a start, that day I showed him satellite pictures of Bhubaneswar -> Orissa -> India -> earth as seen from outer space. He seemed captivated. I also demonstrated an aspect of the relationship of the sun and the earth – `Jab yahan subah hoga, tab America mein raat hoga’, I said. `To jab waha din hoga, yaha raat hoga?’ he asked. I was happy that he was observing a new concept sincerely.

We met around 15 times more. We started with learning English alphabets and numbers. He surprised me by showing familiarity with the alphabets and knowing the Hindi representation of numbers till 30. He pressed the pencil hard onto the lines of a four-line notebook as he wrote `A’. I asked him to practice writing it in home. The next time we met, he had densely filled the page with `A’s.

Without fail, he used to emboss the number 786 (a holy number of Muslims) on the coverpage of his khaata s. `Yeh hamara bhagwan hain’ he used to say. I used to discuss with Preeti (she interacts with the kids – Sanu and Rabi) about his progress and her experience helped. Shukriya practiced writing the English alphabet but he did not yet master the recognition of the sound corresponding to each letter. He learnt the alphabet song (till `t’). He wrote numbers from 1-100 in the notebook with small blue boxes (We used to call it the ‘dabba-wala khata‘) and was getting a grip on adding numbers. We also discussed several concepts like: the solar system, water cycle, photosynthesis and the food chain. In last few sessions, we enjoyed colouring pictures too. These were some of the nice instances in the sessions:
<ol>
<li>He voluntarily recited the alphabet song as soon as we met after our breaks of 2 days.</li>
<li>Almost every time, he completed the homework assigned to him (sometimes he did more than I asked).</li>
<li>He remembered our discussion on photosynthesis – he once referred to it during a discussion we were having on some other issue!</li>
</ol>

Shukriya and his family were eager to send him to the school in Paralakhemundi where his brother Tehsin Khan is studying. Thus, we could take the next step of sending Shukriya to have a more structured learning at this primary school. He now lives there, along with his brother, about 300 kilometers away from Bhubaneswar. They both informally attend classes, tend to vegetable gardens in the school and play with a horse which has strayed into the campus. Tehsin named her Rani.

When Shukriya narrated me his visit to the Nandankaanan zoo, he told that the driver of the safari jeep did not allow him and his friend to sit in it. He said it as if that had no emotional impact on him. I realized how much he was used to being treated like that. Schooling is a long journey and though he is now in school, nothing is certain. I hope he gets well educated and suitably employed. Nandankaanan zoo will still be around. Maybe then, he can enjoy a ride in the safari jeep.
