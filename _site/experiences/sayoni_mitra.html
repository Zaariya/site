Zaariya started as the social service “club” in my college NISER, whose main aim was to promote social awareness and responsibility in our college students. It was the brain child of one of our seniors, Surya Bhaiya and eventually, many student volunteers signed up for it. One of the first activities we performed was the cleanliness drive in our IOP campus.

However, a major turning point (atleast for me) was when we started educating the kids living on the opposite side of the road in the slums. Initially, we would play with the kids and enquire about how far they have studied, whether they ever went to school, their dreams and aspirations and their family situation. All of them had varied life experiences. There were many of them who had been studying in “schools” but hardly knew the alphabets or numbers! There were others too, who had been forced to drop out of school due to lack of money and pressure from family members.

But they had one thing in common, they wanted to study. I wouldn’t say, that they value “education” in the way we do. They are kids who are mostly in the age-group 5-10, who spend their time working, playing and surviving in far harsher conditions than I have been brought up in, of course they cannot understand supreme importance of education that one realises with age. However, they somehow do know that “education” will help them achieve their dreams.

Finally, we divided all the kids amongst the volunteers so that we could focus on each child properly based on his/her needs. Blessy and I were put in charge of Sangeeta, Reshma and Sandhya Reshma.

Sandhya Reshma is the youngest (only 3 years old) and recently, we were successful in admitting her to Bal Sainik School (Nursery). It is lucky that she is so little, she can receive structured education without any delay.

Sangeeta and Reshma are both very contrasting and alike at the same time. Though they both belong to the same age group (8-9), Reshma has been lucky enough to go to school. However, we realised, even though she is supposed to be studying in 6th standard, she’s unable to write the alphabets properly! It highlights the apathetic condition of (a few) government schools. On the other hand, Sangeeta had dropped school because of her mother’s severe illness, because she’s the youngest one (the others are all married, save one) in the family, and somebody had to take care of the household.

The similarity is, both of them are extremely bright students. I did not expect them to learn the alphabets so fast, and they both seem to have a lot of potential. Sangeeta got admitted to the RRL school recently, just like many of the kids who are a part of Zaariya. An enormous thanks to the very helpful government officials, who commended the NISER students’ efforts, and were cooperative enough to take in these kids.

I would say my personal experience has been a very emotional one. A nostalgic one. I never comprehended that teaching kids is that tough, that drilling the basics (alphabets or numbers) is a Herculean task that requires truck-loads of patience. By this journey, I have realised that my parents and kindergarten teachers (infact, the same applies for everyone) who carried this out deserve a huge round of applause! There is a certain wonderful satisfaction that one derives from teaching, and I think I can relate to my parents, teachers and professors better.

I hope Zaariya is successful in expanding further. There are so many kids to be taught!
