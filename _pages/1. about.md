Zaariya is the social service club of NISER, which aims to create awareness about various social issues and stimulate social responsibility among the students of NISER by organizing various events throughout the year. The club also aims to promote processes which are sustainable, socially inclusive and gender equitable to help the poor and marginalized rural people or communities achieve a dignified quality of life. These events include blood donation, cloth donation among others. Activities of this club are chiefly centred around child education, that is, ensuring that all children get access to proper education. To this end, volunteers of our club have taken up the initiative to teach the children living in the slums near Institute of Physics(IOP) on a weekly basis.
