Zaariya – a means to serve the society, to reach out to the needy and the underprivileged is the brainchild of several like-minded NISERites who got together with the aim of bringing about a difference in the world we live in. Spanning over a few weeks there were several activities organized by Zaariya club members.

I remember how a few weeks back the small footpath that led from the main building to the mess was dumped with litter. Every time I crossed that path I couldn’t help but notice plastic cups and wrappers lying all around. The lack of a requisite number of dustbins at appropriate places was indeed a matter of concern not only for me but for many other fellow NISERites. It was then that Zaariya volunteers decided to address this issue and undertook the “Dustbin initiative”. It was a unique experience collecting empty cans, cleaning them, painting them, writing the initials of Zaariya on each newly made dustbin. Our hard work finally paid off when this initiative was greeted with a warm response from NISERites as well as Institute of Physics (IOP) authorities. What had seemed to be a big challenge initially was progressing well. The dustbins had been placed at several locations throughout the campus; they were being used at least. Within a few weeks the litter around the campus had reduced; students were happy for not having to carry used wrappers with them all the way from the mess to the main building looking for a dustbin. Very soon IOP authorities took measures to install larger trash bins at all those locations where Zaariya had set up dustbins. It was indeed a great achievement to have made the authorities realize the gravity of the situation and create a general awareness among everyone about maintaining a clean environment.

There’s nothing that feels better than coming together to help do good and spread happiness. I felt a sense of accomplishment when Zaariya started the drive for collection of clothes for the needy and the way people responded to it and contributed generously. The smile on the faces of the kids in the orphanage made me realize that even a small contribution from a single individual could bring joy in so many lives.

It’s heart-warming that Zaariya has become a means to usher in new initiatives to change our world for the better.
