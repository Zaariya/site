To be compassionate is a rare virtue in this world! Those who are gifted with the capacity to understand the agonies of the fellow beings is indeed a blessed class. Our students at NISER have given an expression of their compassionate minds by forming an organization named “Zaariya” to serve as a medium for translating their concern and feeling for their fellow beings.

The success of rehabilitating Master Tehsin Khan back to schooling after removing him from the clutches of child labour gave them the confidence to undertake such noble acts at a larger scale. The activists of Zaariya have now started teaching children from the nearby slum area who have not been fortunate to be at the schools. They already have identified 39 children of ages between 3 and 10 and are now being prepared to be sent to schools. This magnificent effort comes from them with some financial support from varied people including NISER faculty. A part of their scholarships is spared too to meet some of the expenses. As soon as these children are ready, they are to be enrolled in some good schools to continue with their education, as in the case of Master Tehsin.

The photographs show Zaariya activists helping the children to learn. Every evening they are on the lawns of the Institute of Physics to learn for about an hour and half assisted by the volunteers, to be followed by half an hour of playing with their mentors. The happiness on the faces of these children is beyond description, to be seen to be believed.

Zaariya has taken off to a wonderful start with a magnificent project. This social service organization of the NISER students is here to stay and flourish in the years to come. It is such compassionate minds and humane acts which give us lot of hope and faith in the future of mankind.

‘Sahasrakoti Pranams’ to you my dear children. Your endeavour will bear fruit by lighting the lamp of love and compassion in the lives of thousands in the years to come.
